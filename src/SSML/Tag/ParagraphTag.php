/**
 * Represents a paragraph. This tag provides extra-strong breaks before and after the tag.
 * This is equivalent to specifying a pause with <break strength="x-strong"/>.
 *
 * Example:
 * <speak>
 *   <p>This is the first paragraph. There should be a pause after this text is spoken.</p>
 *   <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
 * </speak>
